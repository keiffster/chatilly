	Theodore Roosevelt was the twenty sixth President of the USA 1901-5. He was a man of great paradox. A gifted scholar who wrote over 30 books, from a wealthy family, he was also a rough cowboy and hunter. He left one enduring legacy: the teddy bear was named after him, the result of him refusing to shoot a bear whilst hunting. Another US President?
